    Runs the Guest Operating System

        The VM's OS (like Ubuntu, Windows, etc.) needs CPU power to function — booting, managing tasks, handling drivers, etc.

    Executes Applications

        Any process or app running inside the VM (like a web server, database, code compiler) uses CPU cycles.

        More vCPUs = more tasks can be processed in parallel.

    Handles Virtualization Overhead

        The hypervisor (e.g., VMware, KVM, Hyper-V) uses CPU to manage virtualization tasks, like scheduling CPU time for each VM.

    Multi-threading and Parallel Work

        More CPUs (or vCPUs) help run multi-threaded apps faster. Think of it like more workers on the job.

    Affects Performance, Responsiveness, and Throughput

        Low CPU allocation = VM feels slow.

        High CPU usage = risk of throttling, lag, or crashing.

💡 Example Use Cases
Workload Type	Recommended vCPU
Lightweight web server	1 vCPU
Medium web app or DB	2–4 vCPU
Build server, ML tasks	4+ vCPU
🔍 TL;DR:

    The CPU in a VM powers everything — from the OS to your apps.
    More CPU = better performance, especially for compute-heavy workloads.


commands in Linux OS to find CPU usage.
1. lscpu  --> This command provides detailed information about the CPU architecture. It doesn't show real-time usage but gives you a summary of your system's CPU capabilities.
2. vmstat -->(Virtual Memory Statistics) shows system performance, including memory, CPU usage, and I/O statistics. It gives an overview of the system's current resource usage.
3. htop --> htop is an interactive, user-friendly version of top, which shows detailed, real-time data on CPU usage, memory, and running processes. It’s more visually appealing and easier to interpret compared to top.


Command	Description	Usage Example
lscpu	Displays detailed CPU architecture information.	lscpu
vmstat	Provides system statistics, including CPU usage.	vmstat 1 (updates every second)
htop	Interactive process viewer showing real-time CPU usage and more.	htop
