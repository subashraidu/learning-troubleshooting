A web application needs a web server like Apache or Tomcat to handle the following core responsibilities:
1. Serving HTTP Requests

Web applications communicate using the HTTP protocol. A web server listens for incoming HTTP requests from clients (usually browsers), processes them, and sends back responses (like HTML pages, JSON data, etc.).

    Apache HTTP Server: Handles static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images).

    Apache Tomcat: Designed for serving Java-based dynamic content (e.g., JSP, Servlets).

2. Processing Dynamic Content

If your application generates pages or data dynamically (e.g., using Java, PHP, Python, etc.), the web server must route the request to an application runtime or interpreter. Tomcat, for example, runs Java web apps by executing Servlets and JSP files.
3. Connection Management

Web servers manage thousands of concurrent client connections, handling:

    Request parsing

    Response formatting

    Persistent or keep-alive connections

    Compression and caching

4. Security Features

They provide built-in security mechanisms:

    HTTPS (SSL/TLS)

    Access controls

    Request filtering

    Logging and monitoring

5. Load Balancing and Scalability

Many web servers support:

    Load balancing across multiple servers

    Reverse proxying

    Integration with caching servers (e.g., Varnish)

Summary

Without a web server, a web application wouldn’t be accessible via a browser, wouldn’t be able to process requests, and wouldn’t scale or secure efficiently.
