 Purpose of RAM in a VM

    Running the Guest OS

        The guest operating system (like Ubuntu, Windows, etc.) inside the VM needs RAM to load and run.

        Just like a regular computer, the OS uses memory for core services and background processes.

    Running Applications

        Any apps or services you run inside the VM (e.g., web servers, databases, IDEs) consume RAM.

        More RAM means you can run more or heavier applications without performance issues.

    Caching and Buffering

        The OS and applications use RAM to cache frequently accessed data for faster performance.

        For example, a database might store query results or indexes in memory to speed up access.

    Swap Reduction

        Adequate RAM helps avoid swapping to disk, which is much slower than RAM.

        If a VM runs out of RAM, it may start using disk-based swap, which hurts performance.

    Performance Isolation

        Each VM is allocated a set amount of RAM, preventing one VM from hogging memory that could affect others on the same host.



RAM in a VM is used to:

    Run the guest OS and applications

    Improve performance through caching

    Avoid slow disk-based swapping

    Isolate workloads on the same physical machine

If you're tuning VM specs, think of RAM as the workspace â€” the bigger it is, the more your VM can do efficiently.
